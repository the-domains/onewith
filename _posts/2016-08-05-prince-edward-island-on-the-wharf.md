# **Prince Edward Island on the Wharf**

My husband and I spent our honeymoon in P.E.I. While there, we spent a lot of time at Richards eating lobster clubs and playing Yatzee.

For this painting I combined two of my favourite pictures.

First, I selected the water from this image. I found it gorgeous how the water faded from blue to purple to reddish-brown sand.

Next I selected this cool ornate building. I loved the sunshine captured on the yellow trim, the siding and the buoy. I ended up removing a bunch of the signage on the front of the building to simplify the image.

Heres some of the process...
